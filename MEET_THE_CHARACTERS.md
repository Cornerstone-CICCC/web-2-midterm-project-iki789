## **Meet the Characters of Kiki’s Anime**
![Meet. the team](https://github.com/Cornerstone-CICCC/web-2-midterm-project-iki789/blob/dev/public/cover.jpg?raw=true)•  **Koki**: The smart and energetic leader of the crew, Koki teams up with Ishishi to handle the crucial task of making fetch requests and delivering packets. Together, they ensure the website runs smoothly and provides the latest anime data without a hitch.

•  **Ishishi**: Koki’s best buddy and twin to Noshishi, Ishishi is quick, reliable, and always ready to tackle tasks. As Koki’s partner in packet delivery, Ishishi works tirelessly to keep things on track.

•  **Noshishi**: The larger and lazier twin, Noshishi isn’t too keen on hard work and spends most of his time eating and sleeping. Despite his laid-back nature, Noshishi has an important job: serving the menu. It’s his only task, but he does it well **(most of the time)!**
