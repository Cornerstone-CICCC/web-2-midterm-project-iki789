At Koki’s Anime, three quirky characters bring the website to life: **Koki**, **Ishishi**, and **Noshishi**.

•  **Koki**: The smart and energetic leader of the crew. Koki. She’s not great so at games, so she found her true calling in the world of anime, Koki teams up with Ishishi to handle the crucial task of making fetch requests and delivering packets. Together, they ensure the website runs smoothly.

•  **Ishishi**: Koki’s best buddy and twin to Noshishi. He is quick, reliable, and always ready to tackle tasks. As Koki’s partner in packet delivery, he works tirelessly to keep things on track.

•  **Noshishi**: The larger and lazier twin, Noshishi isn’t too keen on hard work and spends most of his time eating and sleeping. Despite his laid-back nature, Noshishi has an important job: serving the menu. It’s his only task, but he does it well **(sometimes)!**

Together, these characters bring Koki’s Anime to life and make it fun and functional for everyone!
